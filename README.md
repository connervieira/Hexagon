## Features
### Dark/Light Mode Support
Hexagon fully supports MacOS Mojave's (and above) Dark and Light themes!

### RGB and HEX support
Hexagon supports both RGB and HEX color codes, so you'll always have your preferred format available.

### Native Color Tools
Hexagon uses the default MacOS color palette tools, so you'll most likely already have experience with the Hexagon interface!

### Offline
Unlike nearly every other color selection tool on the planet, Hexagon has zero relianxce on the internet, so you'll be able to use it from anywhere!

### Quick Copy Buttons
Hexagon has the abilty to quickly copy either the RGB or HEX color code as soon as you've settled on a color you like! Just click one of the clearly labeled buttons at the bottom of the screen!

### Wide Color Range
Hexagon doesn't just support whole number RGB values. It's capable of displaying any decimal value you'd like! Even though your display may not be capable of accurately displaying such specific colors, you'll still be able to select them.

### Rounding Mode
What about when you dont need high color options, and just need the standard whole number RGB options? Well Hexagon as you covered here as well! Just check the "Round" button in the top corner!

### Resizable
One simple feature that greatly increases practicality is the ability to resize the Hexagon window. Need a small widget over your existing application? Scale down Hexagon. Need a larger view of the color you're selecting? Just scale it back up!
